### Tools & Technologies Used 🛠️

#### Frontend:

1. **JavaScript (React.js)** : The frontend is built using React.js, providing a dynamic and responsive user interface.
2. **Material UI** : Material UI components are thoughtfully integrated into the design, delivering a clean and modern user interface that enhances the overall user experience.
3. **Tailwind CSS**: Tailwind CSS is our go-to choice for styling, enabling us to create visually appealing and responsive layouts.
4. **TravelAdvisor Rapid API**: We harness the [TravelAdvisor Rapid API](https://rapidapi.com/apidojo/api/travel-advisor) to curate a comprehensive list of attractions, restaurants, and hotels within specified boundaries. This data empowers users to make informed travel decisions.
5. **Redux Toolkit**: Redux Toolkit plays a crucial role in our application by managing state, particularly for the "Add to Wishlist" feature. It ensures a smooth and efficient data flow, enhancing user engagement and trip planning.
6. **LocalStorage**: We utilize the `localStorage` feature in the browser to save and retrieve user data, enhancing the user experience by providing personalized features and preferences.

#### Backend:

1. **Node.js**: The server-side code is written in Node.js, providing a robust backend environment.
2. **Express.js**: Express.js is used to create the RESTful API that communicates with the frontend.
3. **JWT (JSON Web Tokens)**: JWTs are used for secure user authentication.
4. **Cookies**: Cookies are employed to manage user sessions.

#### Database:

1. **User Data**: MongoDB is used to store user profiles, authentication credentials, and personal information. This ensures that user data is organized and readily accessible when needed.
2. **Wishlist Information**: Additionally, MongoDB is leveraged to store wishlist information, allowing users to save and manage their desired places of interest for future trips. This feature enhances the trip planning process and provides a personalized experience for users.

#### Cloud Services:

1. **Google Cloud Platform (GCP)**: GCP services are utilized for various aspects of our application, including deployment, storage, and real-time location tracking. GCP empowers us to provide real-time location tracking features, ensuring users can navigate their chosen destinations with confidence. Additionally, it enhances the autocomplete feature, making place discovery quick and convenient.
2. **Firebase**: Firebase is employed for the deployment of the frontend, ensuring a seamless and responsive user interface. Firebase hosting allows us to efficiently serve the application to users.
3. **Render**: Render is utilized for backend deployment, providing a reliable and scalable infrastructure to handle application requests efficiently.
4. **Cloudinary**: Cloudinary is an integral part of our application, playing a pivotal role in facilitating image upload and management. It ensures that images, including avatar photos and images associated with wishlist items, are seamlessly saved and retrieved from the database. This functionality allows users to personalize their profiles with ease and enriches their travel planning experience by providing visual context through images.
