Yes, that's correct. In order to use props in a component, you need to pass them to the component when it is being rendered. By passing props to a component, you provide the necessary data or functionality that the component needs to render or perform its tasks.

To pass props to a component, you use the component syntax with the props specified as attributes. For example:


<ComponentName prop1={value1} prop2={value2} />
In the above example, ComponentName is the name of the component, and prop1 and prop2 are the props being passed with their corresponding values value1 and value2.

Inside the component, you can access the props using the props object. For example:


const ComponentName = (props) => {
  // Access props using props.prop1, props.prop2, etc.
  // Use the props to render or perform necessary tasks
  return <div>{props.prop1}</div>;
};
By passing props to a component, you enable it to receive and utilize the provided data or functionality, allowing for dynamic rendering and customization based on the props received.
